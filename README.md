Welcome to our project - Doctor appointment system and an Interactive Mood Bot
The main objective of this project is to automate the process of scheduling appointments online. This would include an option for the doctor to accept or reject the request made by the patient. The user needs to select the domain and a recommendation fo the best hospitals would be shown based on the user's location. Another important feature of this project is a Mood Bot, which is a fun-filled interactive platform, for people who would like to elevate their moods.
